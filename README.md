# PROJECT NOVA – Autonomous RFP Response System

Project NOVA is a multi‑agent AI system designed to automate the end‑to‑end
RFP (Request for Proposal) response workflow for industrial B2B companies.  
It reduces tender turnaround time from 5 days to ~12 hours by automating
RFP discovery, technical specification matching, pricing estimation, and
final proposal generation.

## 🚀 Overview

Industries that participate in PSU, Government, and EPC tenders face slow,
manual and error‑prone RFP processes. NOVA solves this by using AI agents:

- **Sales Agent** – Extracts RFP metadata & summaries  
- **Technical Agent** – Extracts specs & generates Spec Match %  
- **Pricing Agent** – Computes pricing using ML and rules  
- **Master Agent** – Orchestrates the entire workflow  
- **Cognitive Mesh DB** – Shared intelligence layer for all agents  

The result is a complete **tender-ready proposal PDF** generated
autonomously.
